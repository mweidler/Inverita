\section{Terminology}

This section explains important terms which is needed to understand
the functionality of Inverita.

\subsection{Backup}
   Inverita can manage several Backups. Each Backup has
         a storage location where the configuration and the
         Backup snapshots are stored.
         Inverita stores the list of Backup in the user's
         configuration directory \monospace{\$HOME/.config/inverita.conf}.

\subsection{Configuration}
         The Backup Configuration specifies the name of the Backup,
         if the data should be encrypted or not, included
         directories, exclude patterns and many more options.
         The configuration file is stored in the backup storage
         location and has the name 'inverita.conf'.

\subsection{Backup snapshot}
         The Backup snapshot is a directory inside the
         backup storage and contains meta data (number of files, sizes, etc.),
         cryptographic digests of all backed up files and the backed up files itself.
         Identical files are linked in all backup snapshots and thus do not
         require additional storage space.
         The directory names of backup snapshots start with a @-sign followed by
         the time stamp when the backup snapshot has been created, e.g. \monospace{@2013-03-02-10-15-31}
