INVERITA Personal Backup Software
=================================


1. SUMMARY
----------

INVERITA Personal Backup tool for Unix/Linux (in the following called INVERITA)
is a software for data backup on various media.

The main features are:
  * Backup data in snapshots
  * Nice and user-friendly user interface
  * Hard-link technology for each backup snapshot to minimize needed media space
  * Integrity validation of backups


2. DESKTOP INTEGRATION and THEMING
-----------------------------------

After package installation, there should appear a new menu entry "Inverita" in the
"Utility" section. Inverita uses automatically the current desktop theme, icons,
fonts, etc.


3. PARAMETERS
-------------

INVERITA can be started with parameters, e.g. inverita -<option>=<value>, -<option2>=<value2>, ...
where <option> can be one of the following:
-iconTheme=ThemeName
    If for whatever reason the current desktop theme is not used, one can force the
    use of a specific theme by setting the theme name with this parameter.

-menusHaveIcons=true
    If for whatever reason the menu icons are not shown, one can force this by using
    this parameter.

-translation=[yes|no|<locale>]
    If for whatever reason the translation of the text displayed by Inverita is not
    working properly, one can control the behaviour by setting the translation parameter.
    yes: use translation and use the system default language (default)
    no: disable translation. English language texts will be used.
    <locale>: use translation and use this locate identifier, e.g. de_DE


4. REQUIREMENTS
---------------

INVERITA is developed and optimized for Unix/Linux operating systems.
It needs a file system on backup medium, that supports hard-links and meta information (user, permissions, dates).
Currently, only the 'ext4' file system is supported. It will not work with FAT/VFAT file systems!
